# Swayam - Modern Application Development

As a part of my college's B.Tech Semester - VIII curriculum, we had to enroll in and complete an online course (by [Swayam](https://swayam.gov.in/ "Swayam Central")). My final year project team and I enrolled in and completed [Modern Application Development](https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc20_cs52/course "Modern Application Development"). 

Most of the weekly assignments were in MCQ format. This repository contains the programming assignments.
